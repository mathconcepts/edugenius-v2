# Changelog

All notable changes to GATE Math are documented here.

## [0.2.0.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Content Intelligence Engine:** Self-improving content loop that gets smarter over time
  - Trend collection from Reddit, Stack Exchange, YouTube, and NewsAPI. Matches external signals to your 10 GATE topics automatically
  - 5-signal priority scoring (user struggle, trend signal, conversion rate, view velocity, coverage gap) decides what content to create next
  - Feedback scoring grades every blog post on engagement, conversion, and relevance. Low performers get auto-archived after 90 days
  - Smart flywheel integration: content-flywheel now picks topics based on priority scores and weaves trend context into Gemini prompts
- **Dark Neubrutalism blog redesign:** Gen Z/Gen Alpha aesthetic with personality
  - Hard 2px borders with content-type accent colors, colored offset shadows (3px 3px) that shift on hover
  - Space Grotesk font (geometric, modern), uppercase bold labels, sharp 4px corners
  - Single-column card feed, topic filter pills, sort tabs (Recent/Trending/Most Read), content type tabs
  - CSS-only stagger entrance animations (80ms per card) + scroll-reveal (progressive enhancement)
  - Full `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility support
  - Sticky floating CTA bar on blog posts bridges readers to the app
  - Zero JS, single font load, ~4KB CSS total
- **App declutter:** Compact hero bar, removed welcome banner, daily challenge threshold raised to 3+ reviews, subtle inline onboarding nudge

### Fixed
